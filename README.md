# HOW TO EDIT THE MAP
IMP : When the map editor is open, you MUST place the first block of the road at the top left of the screen, as this is where the car spawn at the start!<br />
1) Click on the left click of your mouse to change the two forms of the map either straight blocks on corner blocks.<br />
2) Click on the right click of your mouse to change the angle of each chosen block.<br />
3) Click on "spacebar" to place it when the cursor is inside the top left corner.<br />
4) You can move the screen afterwards using the right/left/up/down key to place the other blocks anywhere on the map.<br />
5) When you finish creating the map click on esc to close.<br />
PS: Please create a logic map.<br />
